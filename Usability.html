      <h2> Things I have done to make this website usable... </h2>
<body>
<p> 1. I have used a color scheme that makes these pages easy on the eyes. A dark text
      on top of a light background, calls for a sufficient contrast. </p>
<p> 2. When there is a new topic being presented, the heading is bold and the text size 
      increases. The text throughout the website is consistent, and clean. </p>
<p> 3. The text is also spread out into multiple paragraphs, which makes the text clean
      and consistent as well. </p>
<p> 4. Other than this Usability page, I decided to make my webiste one page filled with information. 
      I felt as though this made my website easily accessible, and it gets the point across for who I am. </p>
<p> 5. Links on this site will open in the same window! All of the links are usable, and are there to show
      the many things that I have accomplished throughout this course.</p>
<p> 6. This website uses css for layout. The website is confirmed to be compatible with FireFox, Chrome, and Safari.
      </p>
<p> 7. Within this website there are pdf files that are accessible right on the main page. I decided
      to have it accessible on the main page, rather than a linked source, because it is clean and more 
      professional. </p>
<p> 8. The document type is declared as an html, and is encoded to interpret the
      English Language. </p>
