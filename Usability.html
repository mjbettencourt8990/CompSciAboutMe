      <h2> Things I have done to make this website usable... </h2>
<body>
<p> 1. I have used a color scheme that makes these pages easy on the eyes. A dark text
      on top of a light background, calls for a sufficient contrast. </p>
<p> 2. When there is a new topic being presented, the heading is bold and the text size 
      increases. The text throughout the website is consistent, and clean. </p>
<p> 3. The text is also spread out into multiple paragraphs, which makes the text clean
      and consistent as well. </p>
