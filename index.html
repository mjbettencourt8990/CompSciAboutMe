     <p> Hello! I am Morgan Bettencourt, a Junior at Florida Gulf Coast University. I am majoring in Mathematics, and 
      minoring in Computer Science. I have found this major change to be a little bit difficult, but I 
      am adjusting well. I look forward to all of the opportunities that my studies will provide me with. </p>
              
<p>
      Outside of my education, I work as a manager at Kilwins Chocolates, as well as a server
      at night. I pride myself on my motivation to work two jobs, and take six classes; all while
      paying for my education. I enjoy volunteering through Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit
      organization that builds afforadable homes for families in need. I also volunteer with United
      Way, making food bags for people in need, as well as participating in Harry Chapin Food Banks.
                  </p>

      In my opinion, my top accomplishment, is being awarded academic scholarships to cover my four years of education. This
      shows perserverance,and dedication to my education. These awards do not only reflect my past accomplishements, but also
      proves that I can maintain the grades to remain eligable for these scholarships. 
                  </p>
    
   <p>   As a manager, I am learning the responsibilities that it takes to run a business, which is what I will hopefully do on my own someday. 
     As a Mathematics Major, with a minor in Computer Science, I find myself more than qualified to take on a full-time position 
     post-college graduation. Throughout my college experience, I have been placed in math courses, business courses, and computer programming courses,
       which will set my above others in certain categories of employment. </p>

      I am just beginning my computer programming courses, here at FGCU. I am currently enrolled in an 
      Introduction to Computer Science course, along with a course revolved around Computational Technology. Below are projects
      and reports that I have completed in this course:
