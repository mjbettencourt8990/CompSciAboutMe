<h1> About Me!</h1>
<p> Hello! I am Morgan Bettencourt, a Junior at Florida Gulf Coast University.
I am majoring in Mathematics, and minoring in Computer Science. I have found
this major change to be a little bit difficult, but I am adjusting well. I
look forward to all of the opportunities that my studies will provide me
with. Outside of my education, I work as a manager at Kilwins Chocolates, as well as a server at night. I pride myself on my 
      motivation to work two jobs, and take six classes; all while paying for my education. I enjoy volunteering
      through Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit organization that builds afforadable homes for families in need. I also
      volunteer with United Way, making food bags for people in need, as well as participating in Harry Chapin Food Banks. </p>
