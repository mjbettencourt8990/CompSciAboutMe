<h1> About Me!</h1>
<p> Hello! I am Morgan Bettencourt, a Junior at Florida Gulf Coast University.
I am majoring in Mathematics, and minoring in Computer Science. I have found
this major change to be a little bit difficult, but I am adjusting well. I
look forward to all of the opportunities that my studies will provide me
with. </p>
